changes: 
  - bugfix: "Hot ice burn in fires (made a change to obj_defense.dm where in the obj/fire_act proc i added at the end of the proc . = ..(), allowing it to call for the parent, i initially put it at the start obj/fire_act proc but it caused hot ice to runtime when burned. This change will affect everything that uses fire_act and fire_react procs)"
  - rscdel: "Removed hot ice ability to make furnitures (to do this i had to add a new flag to all the base mats that had the MAT_CATEGORY_RIGID flag, the new flag is MAT_CATEGORY_BASE_RECIPES, if this flag is true then the four basic recipes will appear, otherwhise it wont)"
